# 👋 Hello!
# Welcome to *asic-interview* website! 🚀

With VLSI companies constantly pushing the boundaries of performance, power efficiency, and cost, there is a growing demand for **skilled VLSI engineers**. However, securing a role in this competitive field requires thorough preparation, not just in technical concepts but also in problem-solving and communication skills.

## 💡 Why This Website?

I decided to create this website because I have seen talented engineers struggle during interviews—not due to a lack of knowledge, but because they were unprepared for the format, the depth of questioning, and the mental pressure that comes with technical interviews. Many candidates feel nervous or overwhelmed in their first few interviews. I have been there myself. 

The long hours of technical discussions, the stress of solving problems on the spot, and the challenge of explaining complex ideas concisely can be mentally exhausting. But like anything else, practice builds confidence. Over time, I learned how to approach these interviews strategically, stay composed, and articulate my thoughts effectively.

## 🎯 What You Will Find Here

Throughout my career, I have encountered a wide range of interview questions—some highly practical and industry-focused, others purely theoretical, and a few that seemed designed just to test how candidates handle pressure rather than their actual engineering skills. This website aims to prepare you for all types of questions, including:

- Practical, real-world VLSI challenges that test how well you can apply knowledge to actual design problems.
- Theoretical and textbook-style questions that focus on fundamental concepts.
- Tricky and uncommon problems that might appear in some interviews but are rarely encountered in actual chip design work.
- Behavioral and problem-solving questions that assess your approach to debugging, teamwork, and decision-making.

## 🏗️ Website Structure

This website is structured into multiple sections, covering essential topics such as:

- **RTL coding**  
- **Logic design**  
- **Low-power principles**  
- **Clocking and reset architectures**  
- **Clock domain crossings (CDC)**  
- **Debugging methodologies**  
- **Logical reasoning**  

You can navigate through the chapters based on your interests or the specific areas you need to improve.

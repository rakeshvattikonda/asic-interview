# DFT (Design for Test) Interview Questions

## 1. What is scan chain in DFT?
A scan chain converts **flip-flops into shift registers**, allowing **test patterns** to be shifted in and out.

## 2. What is stuck-at fault testing?
A **stuck-at-0** or **stuck-at-1** fault occurs when a signal remains at a fixed value, regardless of input.

## 3. What is ATPG?
**Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG)** generates test patterns to detect faults in ASICs.

## 4. What is BIST (Built-In Self-Test)?
BIST is a **self-checking circuit** that runs **internal tests** without external test vectors.

## 5. What is boundary scan (JTAG)?
JTAG (IEEE 1149.1) allows **testing of I/O pins** without physical probes.

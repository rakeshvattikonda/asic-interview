# Mixed-Signal Design Interview Questions

## 1. What are the key challenges in mixed-signal verification?
- **Analog-digital interface modeling**
- **Noise coupling effects**
- **Cross-domain synchronization**

## 2. How does an ADC work?
An **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)** samples an analog signal and converts it into a **digital word** using **quantization**.

## 3. What are common ADC architectures?
- **SAR ADC** (Successive Approximation Register)
- **Pipeline ADC**
- **Sigma-Delta ADC**

## 4. What is phase noise in PLLs?
Phase noise is the **jitter in frequency output** of a PLL caused by noise sources.

## 5. What is charge pump leakage?
Leakage in charge pumps **causes voltage drift**, affecting **PLL stability**.

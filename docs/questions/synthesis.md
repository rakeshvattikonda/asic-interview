# Synthesis & Static Timing Analysis (STA) Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What is the purpose of logic synthesis in ASIC design?

Logic synthesis converts **RTL code** (Verilog/VHDL) into a **gate-level netlist** using a standard cell library. The synthesis tool optimizes the design based on:
- Timing constraints
- Power consumption
- Area optimization

The generated netlist is then used in the Physical Design flow.

---

## 2. What is technology mapping in synthesis?

Technology mapping is the process of mapping **generic Boolean logic** to specific standard cells from a target library. The synthesis tool selects the best **gates, multiplexers, and flip-flops** to optimize for **timing, power, and area**.

---

## 3. What are the main inputs required for synthesis?

Synthesis requires the following inputs:
- RTL design (Verilog/VHDL)
- Standard cell library (Liberty `.lib` file)
- Design constraints (`.sdc` file) specifying timing, clock frequencies, and delays

---

## 4. What are the different synthesis constraints?

Synthesis constraints include:
- **Clock constraints**: Defines clock frequency, uncertainty, and transition times.
- **Input/output constraints**: Defines arrival times, drive strengths, and delays.
- **False paths & multi-cycle paths**: Exclude unnecessary timing paths from STA.
- **Design rule constraints**: Limits maximum fanout, transition time, and capacitance.

---

## 5. What are the main optimization goals in synthesis?

The main optimization goals are:
- Timing closure (meeting setup and hold constraints)
- Area minimization (reducing logic footprint)
- Power optimization (reducing dynamic and leakage power)

---

## 6. What is meant by timing closure?

Timing closure means that the design meets:
- **Setup timing**: Data is launched and captured within the required time.
- **Hold timing**: Data does not arrive too early, preventing incorrect latching.

A design is **timing clean** when there are no setup or hold violations.

---

## 7. What is static timing analysis (STA), and how does it work?

STA is a method of analyzing a design's timing **without simulation**. It works by:
- Breaking down the design into **timing paths**.
- Calculating delays for each **path from launch to capture**.
- Checking if paths meet **setup and hold constraints**.

STA does not depend on **input vectors**, making it faster than dynamic timing analysis.

---

## 8. What is the difference between setup and hold time?

- **Setup time**: The minimum time data must be stable before the clock edge.
- **Hold time**: The minimum time data must remain stable after the clock edge.

Violating setup time results in **data corruption**, while violating hold time causes **metastability**.

---

## 9. What are false paths in STA?

A **false path** is a timing path that does not affect the design functionality and can be ignored in timing analysis. Examples include:
- Paths between unrelated clock domains.
- Paths disabled by logic conditions.
- Paths not exercised in functional mode.

False paths are excluded using **set_false_path** constraints.

---

## 10. What is a multi-cycle path, and how is it handled in STA?

A **multi-cycle path** is a timing path where data is allowed to take more than one clock cycle to propagate. It is defined using:
- `set_multicycle_path` constraint

Example: A path that takes **two clock cycles** instead of one allows **relaxed setup timing**.

---

## 11. What is clock skew, and how does it affect timing?

Clock skew is the **difference in clock arrival times** at different registers. It affects:
- **Setup timing**: Negative skew helps setup, while positive skew worsens setup time.
- **Hold timing**: Positive skew helps hold, while negative skew worsens hold timing.

Clock skew is minimized using **balanced clock trees (CTS)**.

---

## 12. What is the impact of clock jitter on STA?

Clock jitter is the **short-term variation in clock edges**. It causes:
- **Increased setup time requirement** (reducing the timing margin).
- **Hold violations** if not considered properly.

Jitter is handled by defining **clock uncertainty** in STA.

---

## 13. What are the different types of delays considered in STA?

- **Combinational delay**: Delay through logic gates.
- **Clock-to-Q delay**: Delay from a flip-flop output change after the clock edge.
- **Setup and hold margins**: Ensures data is captured correctly.
- **Wire delay (interconnect delay)**: Delay caused by metal routing in layout.

---

## 14. What is derating in STA, and why is it needed?

Derating accounts for **process variations and uncertainties** by **scaling timing values**.

- **Advance On-Chip Variation (AOCV)** applies **location-based variations**.
- **Parametric On-Chip Variation (POCV)** applies **statistical variations**.

Derating helps make designs more robust.

---

## 15. What is max transition, and why is it important?

Max transition defines the **maximum allowable signal rise/fall time**. If violated:
- Signal integrity issues can arise.
- Setup and hold timings may be impacted.
- Higher power consumption due to increased short-circuit currents.

Max transition violations are fixed by **adding buffers**.

---

## 16. What are max capacitance violations?

Max capacitance violations occur when the load capacitance on a net exceeds the library limit, causing:
- **Increased delay** due to large RC effects.
- **Signal degradation**.

Fixes include **buffer insertion** and **cell resizing**.

---

## 17. What is hold fixing, and how is it done?

Hold violations occur when **data propagates too fast**, causing incorrect latching.

Hold time violations are fixed by:
- Adding **delay buffers** in the data path.
- Adjusting **clock skew** to slow down data capture.

---

## 18. What is the significance of Slack in STA?

Slack is the **difference between required and actual arrival times**. It indicates timing safety:

- **Positive slack**: Timing is met.
- **Negative slack**: Timing is violated.

Slack values are used to determine if a design is **timing clean**.

---

## 19. What is the impact of Metal Layers on delay?

Higher metal layers have **lower resistance but higher capacitance**, while lower metal layers have **higher resistance but lower capacitance**.

- **Critical nets** use **higher metal layers** for speed.
- **Power and clock signals** use **thicker top metal layers**.

---

## 20. How is power optimization handled during synthesis?

Power optimization techniques during synthesis include:
- **Clock gating** to reduce dynamic power.
- **Multi-Vt cells** to balance leakage power vs performance.
- **Low-power libraries** for optimized standard cells.

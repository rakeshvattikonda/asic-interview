Format in mulyiple blocks so that I can manually copy Verilog blocks and wrap them with ``` myself.

Give me 20 moderately difficult interview questions in Physical Design (PD). Give me the answers and format the text in *.md format for me to copy. Make sure the format is maintained for statements which start with "-". In general don't do too much "bold" texts. I dont like it.
